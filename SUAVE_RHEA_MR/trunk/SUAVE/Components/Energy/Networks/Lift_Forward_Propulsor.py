    """ This is a complex version of battery_propeller with a battery powering propellers through
        electric motors. In this case we have 2 sets of motors at different motors that can be controlled seperately
        
        This network adds 2 extra unknowns to the mission. The first is
        a voltage, to calculate the thevenin voltage drop in the pack.
        The second is torque matching between motor and propeller.
        
        We have two inputs, the forward throttle and the lift throttle setting

        Since this is an airplane first and foremost, the "throttle" will be for forward thrust
        The new unknown will be for lift throttle, because of the assumption on throttle something needs to be done...

        Want only 1 residual on voltage
    
        Assumptions:
        For any segment using this, body angle can't be an unknown.
